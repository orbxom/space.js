#Galaxy Builder Description


The Galaxy Builder is a C# program that randomly builds a galaxy. The galaxy will be built in parallel starting at the highest level and narrowing down. 


 


Level 0 - Universe 


Level 1 - Galaxy Cluster / Void 


Level 2 - Galaxy 


Level 3 - Solar System / Nebulae 


Level 4 -  Celestial Body / Space station / Ship 


 


To begin, the user will enter the number of Galaxy Clusters they wish to have exist in the Universe. The computer will then generate all of the Galaxy Clusters. Each cluster will be randomly given a resource spending limit which defines how populate or sparse the Galaxy Cluster will be. 


 


Next, Each Galaxy cluster will be populate with galaxies. Again each galaxy will gain a portion of the clusters resource spending limit.  


 


Next, each galaxy will be populated with solar systems and nebulas with each getting a portion of the galaxies resource spending limit. 


 


Finally, each solar system will be populated with planets, moons, comets, asteroid belts with each having its resources defined by the allotted resource spending limit. Rare resources will consume more of the spending limit, while cheap resources will consume less. Each Celestial body will random decide what types of resources will be offered. 


 


Planets in addition to rolling resources, will roll types which will affect habitability etc..
